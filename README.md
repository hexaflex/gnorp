### gnorp

Gnorp is a library of random bits and bobs I use to write [WebGPU][1] applications. It provides some utility packages, types and functions building ontop of [GLFW][2] and WebGPU using [Mach][3] core libraries.

**Note**: This is a work in progress and will be added to as the need arrises. I have zero experience with WebGPU and very little with graphics programming in general, so expect bugs and questionable implementations. I will address these as I run into them.
